## What Is Elexon?
---
Elexon is a Lua script made for YimMenu, a GTA5 LEGACY modmenu

If installed correctly, it will load automatically when YimMenu starts.
---

## Requirements
---
Windows

YimMenu

Ability to copy and paste files

That’s it.
---

## Installation (Very Easy)
---
Follow every step exactly.
Do not skip anything.

### Step 1: Download the Files

From this repository, download both of these:

Elexon 1.72 Beta.lua

elexon-incl (this is a folder)

⚠️ You must have both the file and the folder.

### Step 2: Open the Correct Folder

Press Windows Key + R

Paste this exactly into the box:

`%AppData%\YimMenu\scripts`


Press Enter

A folder will open.
This is the only correct location.

### Step 3: Put the Files There

Inside the scripts folder:

Copy `Elexon 1.72 Beta.lua`

Copy the `elexon-incl` folder

Paste both directly into scripts.
---

## Folder Structure
---
When done, it must look like this:

```text
scripts
│
├── Elexon 1.72 Beta.lua
└── elexon-incl
```

✅ Correct:

Both items are directly inside scripts

❌ Wrong:

Putting elexon-incl inside another folder

Renaming files

Putting files anywhere else
---

## Common Mistakes
---
❌ Missing elexon-incl

❌ Files inside the wrong folder

❌ Renaming the .lua file

❌ Putting files in downloads instead of scripts

Any of these will break the script.
---

## Troubleshooting
---
Elexon does not show up in YimMenu

Check:

`Elexon 1.72 Beta.lua` is inside `C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\YimMenu\scripts`

`elexon-incl` is inside `C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\YimMenu\scripts`

Nothing is renamed

If all three are true, it will work.
